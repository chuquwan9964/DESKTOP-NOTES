Hello girl,my pretty beautiful princess.I have eaten some food and I am stuffed.Life is always simple:studying and wasting time.I don't want to waste time,but there are some things that I can't control.I am not god,I made mistake too.What I could only do is what I like to do,I believed that a person who is doing his/her favorite things is fortunate.But not everyone is lucky.We all have grown up,we have to face the challenge from life,they may beat someone,but they can't beat us even if it is a tough time now.Studying is a  long period,which can get most person who ever wanted to be successful or created achievements given up.Yes,only few people could arrive the other side of success.I miss you,I want to live with you,because you are my ideal girlfriend,my ideal wife.I of course can be a regular man who get a ordinary job that is suffcient to feed his family,what a simple and happy life! But I can't,I am inborn with great responsibility and as long as I have breath,I will pursue my dream that have rooted in my heart and will never change.
																-- With all sincerity
																-- Your true love
