Hey my girl,maybe you want to know why I wrote this diary,it is because I miss you very much.It has been only one day since we left each other yesterday,but I deem that it has been a long day without you who is my sweetheart.I am thinking about our future,oh,not good,I have little time to persue my dream that is entering a good university by passing the postgraduate examination,and the opposite aspect is your happiness,if I try my best to pursue my dream,the only thing I regret is your happiness,I can't give you happiness now,but I also don't want to be a oridinary person in this world,I want to achieve my value,to be the great man in the world.These two things are my heart-knots:I want you to be happy,but I also want you don't worry about the material life,but I realize the reality gradually,these are merely mirages.You are pretty pure girl,your innocence attracts me to love you,I will forever be your protector by your side no matter if you belong to me.I always believe our future is bright,although I spent all my luck on meeting you,but I still believe that there is a miracle in my life.
