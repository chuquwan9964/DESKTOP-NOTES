Good morning,sweetheart,I will definitely do what I have said.It is 8:26 AM now,You must be sleeping.Do you dream?Am I in your dream ?The answer is certainly yes,because I am always in your heart,you are in my heart too.The sunny sun come finally,although a little black clouds block it,but can't stop it glow dazzlingly.The brilliant sunshine like a smile on your face,which is shining me,giving me infinite power.You are like the pure snow in my heart,I won't let anything or anyone stain you a little.
