```
I will go to the CET4 tomorrow,can I pass the exam eventually ? I don't know now.But it's clear that I will continually study English regardless of whether there is exam or not.What am I learing English for ? I can definitely say that what I am learning English for is not for preparing exam or something like educational task.The level of my English ability is still low now,but achievement you will make in the future is not finished by one day
