Only one who had ever lost understand how to treasure.It seems that my gray future is going to have a large turn,which is my degree certificate.I seem have some way about money to solve this long-annoyed trouble.But I can't count my chickens before they hatch.I still have the worst plan .Alought I can't take part in the postgraduate exam,I study as usual.Because I have known the study essence.I am not studying for someone or something,it's for my belief and dream.There is a long way to arrive the land of knowledge in where most people give up.This is the last chance that I can achieve my dream,thank you god,I will go out of my  way to do what I want to do and what worth doing.I will never give the way to another.I am the best one.Thanks god!!!
