Fight for future!!!A truly tough man will not be beaten by difficults and reality.Sometimes,there is only one thing can beat you,which is yourself.There is no need for anything reliable on which a truly strong man should rely.I think I am that kind of man.No matter what you have been through,no matter what kind of person you were past,just remember,the thing that determines your future is not the past you had,but the mind you have now.What you have done now is far away from your target,keep advancing yourself untill you die.Can I succeed?Let's wait and see.Keep moving,fighting,then you will own the life which you yearn for.Does it block your road to future?No,It will never beat me.Everybody is making progress,it's like a race,and you will be the first man arrives the destination!
