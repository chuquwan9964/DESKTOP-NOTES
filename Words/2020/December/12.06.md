```love
    It has been a long time we haven't seen each other.My dad,how were you going lately?I miss you pretty much.Thank you for giving me a happy childhood,these memories constantly appear in my mind,which I will keep  in my heart forever.Your kind face,warm hands,accompany with me in my entire childhood.I am so happy to have the best father in the world.But it is unfortunately that we can't see each other frequently because I become a true man like you,I have great responsibility to finish.I won't let you down.I really miss you very very much,but I have my stuff to do.I want to go home too,but I can't.Your kind face appears still in my mind,which I will treasure for the rest of my life.I will be an achiever,by then I can stand before you and say: I am your pride.

Dear friend,I am so glad that you want have a study in China and I will recommend some universities by my experience and knowledge of China universities to you.The following is my recommendation.
Due to I have no idea of your subjects in which you major,all of the specialties are in my consideration.First,if you have interest in some art or literature,the HeNan Institute of Engineering will be your first choise.It was found in 1955 and has dense literature climate which will intoxicate you and inspire your inspiration of creativity that is pretty important for an arts student.It also has a large area in which you can travel as free as a bird without worry about walking out of the campus.Second,if you prefer be a Science student,Tsinghua University can't be more porper for you.It is one of the most oldest famous universities in China and also at a rank of No.1.It has long been the holy land of knowledge for many Chinese students.You will get the best education in there,but it's difficult to pass the examination,I wish you success.These are all my recommendations that I wish these are helpful to you.Thank you for consulting me about your future,see you in China.
	With all sincerity
	Your friend
