###### 1

###### early decision

> 提前录取

###### admission

​	`[ UC] ~ (to sth)the act of accepting sb into an institution, organization, etc.; the right to enter a place or to join an institution or organization （机构、组织等的）准许加入，加入权，进入权`

> Early decision—you apply to one school? and admission is binding—seems like a great choice for nervous applicants

###### binding

​	`~ (on/upon sb)that must be obeyed because it is accepted in law 必须遵守的；有法律约束力的`

> Early decision—you apply to one school? and admission is binding—seems like a great choice for nervous applicants

###### applicant

> Early decision—you apply to one school? and admission is binding—seems like a great choice for nervous applicants(申请人)

###### 2

> There are, frankly, an astonishing(惊人的) number of exceptional(杰出的) colleges in America, and for any given student, there are a number of schools that are a great fit. When students become too fixated（专注）on a particular school early in the admissions process, that fixation can lead to severe disappointment if they don’t get in or, if they do? the possibility that they are now bound to go to a school that, given time for further reflection, may not actually be right for them

###### insofar

> Insofar as(就目前而言) early decision offers a genuine admissions edge(优势), that advantage goes largely to students who already have numerous advantages. The students who use early decision tend to be those who have received higher-quality college guidance, usually a result of coming from a more privileged background

###### in this regard

> In this regard(就这点而言)，there’s an argument against early decision，as students from lower-income families are far less likely to have the admissions know-how to navigate the often confusing early deadlines.

###### payroll

> There is another survey, sometimes referred to as the “payroll(工资单) survey” that assesses 400 000 businesses based on their reported payrolls

###### self-employed

> 自己经营的

###### take side

> It also leads to serious mis judgments. Democrats and Republicans can and will take sides(站在...一边) on a number of issues
